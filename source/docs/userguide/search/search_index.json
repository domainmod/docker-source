This feature enables you to perform complete backups and restores of your DomainMOD database. This allows you to export your entire system in a single file so that it can easily be backed up and/or restored, which is helpful if you want to perform regular backups of your data, you need to move DomainMOD to a new server, or you want to change your installation method. This process backs up the data saved in your database. If you also want to save your database connection information, you should backup your /_includes/config.inc.php file. Note Before you can use Backup & Restore you must update the permissions on the /var/www/html/domainmod/temp folder (\" chmod 777 /var/www/html/domainmod/temp \"). If you're unsure how to do this your web hosting provider should be able to assist you.

This option uses your domain registrar's API to retrieve information required to add domains, so unfortunately it only works if your registrar has an API and support for it has been built into DomainMOD. Before using this option make sure your API credentials have been saved with your registrar account. Supported Registrars The following registrars are currently supported by the Domain Queue: Above.com, DNSimple, DreamHost, Dynadot, eNom, Fabulous, Freenom (Reseller Accounts Only), Gandi, GoDaddy, Internet.bs, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, OpenSRS, ResellerClub Usage Requirement In order to use the Domain Queue you must first setup the cron job that comes with DomainMOD. Click on Domains on the main menu. Click the Add Domains To Queue button on the Domains page. On the dropdown list, choose the registrar account that you would like to import using the Domain Queue. If requested, paste in a list of the domains you want to add to the Domain Queue. This is not always required, as some domain registrars will retrieve the list of domains from your account automatically. Click the Add Domains button. You will now be taken to the Domain Queue page, where you can see the status of your domain imports. You can also access the Domain Queue by clicking on Queue on the main menu (this menu option is only available when you have domains being processed in the queue). Once all of your imports have completed you can click the Clear Completed button in order to clear the queue. API Notes This section contains various notes and things to watch out for when using the domain registrar APIs. DreamHost DreamHost does not currently allow the WHOIS privacy status of a domain to be retrieved via their API, so all domains added to the Domain Queue from a DreamHost account will have their WHOIS privacy status set to No by default. Freenom Freenom currently only gives API access to reseller accounts. Gandi Gandi does not currently allow the WHOIS privacy status of a domain to be retrieved via their API, so all domains added to the Domain Queue from a Gandi account will have their WHOIS privacy status set to No by default. GoDaddy When retrieving your list of domains from GoDaddy, the current limit is 1,000 domains. If you have more than this you should export the full list of domains from GoDaddy and paste it into the Domains to add field when adding domains via the Domain Queue. NameSilo NameSilo's domains have 6 possible statuses: Active, Expired (grace period), Expired (restore period), Expired (pending delete), Inactive, and Pending Outbound Transfer When retrieving your list of domains via the API, Inactive domains are not returned. When retrieving the details of a specific domain via the API, Inactive and Expired (pending delete) domains will not return any data. ResellerClub ResellerClub does not allow users to retrieve a list of their domains via the API, nor do they return the Auto Renewal status when retrieving the details of a domain.

For security reasons DomainMOD only supports the MySQLi extension. If you're receiving messages that the MySQLi extension is unavailable in PHP you will need to install and enable it on your server before you can use DomainMOD. Note As of v4.07, DomainMOD uses the PDO extension instead of the MySQLi extension. Configuration Can I import my domains into DomainMOD using a CSV file? Not currently, but this is something that we're investigating for the future. If your domain registrar has an API, and it's supported by DomainMOD , you can use the Domain Queue to automatically import your domains. Does DomainMOD support multiple languages? Yes! As of v4.16.0 DomainMOD supports Dutch, English (Canada), English (United States), French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. If you speak one of these languages, you will probably be horrified at the quality of the current translations. This is because an automated translation service was used for this, but I hope the quality of the translations will improve greatly over time. If you would like to help improve the translations, feel free to head over to our translations page on GitHub . Which domain registrar APIs does DomainMOD currently support? DomainMOD currently supports Above.com, DNSimple, DreamHost, Dynadot, eNom, Fabulous, Freenom (Reseller Accounts Only), Gandi, GoDaddy, Internet.bs, Name.com, NameBright, Namecheap, NameSilo, OpenSRS, and ResellerClub. Usage How many domains can I manage with DomainMOD? Theoretically there's no limit on the number of domains you can manage, it just depends on your server hardware and the settings chosen in DomainMOD. The default settings can handle thousands of domains, and over 10,000 depending on how much information you've chosen to display on the front page, but if things start slowing down you can enable large mode to speed things up. Large mode uses a different method for displaying the information on the main domain page, and although it doesn't offer as many of the advanced features as the default settings, it allows you to manage a lot more domains. Can I use DomainMOD to sell domains? The primary use for DomainMOD is to manage a large portfolio of domains, and it currently doesn't have any sales features, such as being able to host sales letter landing pages. This is something we're looking at implementing in a future version of DomainMOD. If all you want to do is track the amount you sold a domain for, you can create a Custom Field, which will allow you to record the sales amount for your domains. I don't need to keep track of the fees associated with my domains. Can I disable this feature? There's currently no way to disable fees, as the system requires them in order to link the database tables, but if you don't care about keeping track of the fees you can just enter zeros for all of the costs. I noticed you can set the registration, transfer, and renewal prices for domains via their domain registrars, but can you set a purchase price for a specific domain? For example, if I purchase a domain from a 3rd party marketplace can I record this information in DomainMOD? Although this is not a standard field, you can use Custom Fields to keep track of the purchase price of your domains. Is it possible to display the custom fields I've created on the main domain page as a column? This is something we're still investigating, as we realize how helpful this feature would be for some people, however if it happens it's probably going to be a while still. Although on the surface it seems like it may be pretty easy to implement, there's actually quite a bit to it and it's going to take quite a bit of work. Also, since you can accomplish pretty much the same thing by exporting your domain list and sorting the exported data in something like excel (since it includes all of your custom fields), implementing this within the UI is not very high on the priority list. Note As of v4.13, you can now display your Custom Fields on the main domain page. Are the domain expiration dates updated automatically using the domain's WHOIS information? No, expiration dates currently need to be updated manually when the domains are renewed. Expiration dates can be updated one-by-one or by using the Bulk Updater . Do you plan to add API support for domain registries? For API imports we've been trying to focus on actual registrars, since unlike registries they cover more than just one (or a few) domain extensions, and actual registrars are what most domainers use, which is who DomainMOD is primarily for. There are always exceptions to this of course, but in general this is the case. Also, if we were to start adding API import support for registries this would open up a pretty big can of worms, since there are literally hundreds of registries that could be added. If we add one registrar we add support for all of the extensions that registrar has, whereas if we add support for a registry we only add support for a single extension (or in some cases a few extensions). So although registry support may happen at some point, it's not currently very high on the priority list. Is it possible to encrypt the data stored in DomainMOD? It's not currently possible to encrypt the data in the database, however it's something we're hoping to implement in some way in the future. Based on our research it wouldn't be a small task to implement, and unfortunately, all things considered, it's just not one of the top priorities at the moment. Adding encryption would also create quite a few challenges with some features we have planned for the future.

We'll walk you through the first few steps you need to take with a new installation, and after completing the steps below you'll be ready to start adding your domains. If you haven't installed DomainMOD yet, please see the Getting Started section. Login The first thing you need to do is login to your new DomainMOD installation. The default username and password are admin , and after you login for the first time you'll be prompted to change your password, which you should do immediately. The admin account that gets created during installation has full control of your DomainMOD installation, so you should store the password in a safe place. Assets After you've logged in you'll need to add a couple pieces of information to the system before you can start adding your domains. We'll refer to these pieces of information as Assets, and they're the building blocks of DomainMOD. Assets include things like the domain registrars that you use, your domain registrar accounts, the categories you want to use for grouping similar domains, and so on. Since every domain must have an owner and belong to a domain registrar and domain registrar account, these are the first Assets that you'll need to add to DomainMOD. The easiest way to proceed with the next steps is to think of one of your domain registrar accounts and use its details as you walk through the below sections. Add An Owner Although recommended, adding an owner at this stage is optional. If you don't add one now you can use the default owner, \"[no owner]\" for the remaining steps on this page, and you can then go back later and edit the default owner.

Security Although we've done our best to secure DomainMOD, unfortunately there are many factors that could cause security holes, such as the software being run on insecure hardware, software like PHP and MySQL having out-of-date versions with known vulnerabilities, easy-to-guess passwords being used, and so on. Due to these factors we recommend the following steps to help secure your DomainMOD installation. Secure your installation with an SSL Certificate. Do not use easy-to-guess passwords. Ever . Although DomainMOD has its own authentication system, we recommend that you also use HTTP authentication on your installation directory to add an extra layer of security. Do not store your account passwords or API keys in DomainMOD. Although the ability to save this information exists, use it at your own risk . This information is fairly secure if you run DomainMOD on your local computer, but there's a much higher risk of someone gaining access to it if you host the site on a server that is accessible to the outside world. Warning Saving your API keys (and other relevant API connection information) in DomainMOD is necessary if you want to use the Domain Queue, however we recommend that you only save this information temporarily while you're using the Domain Queue, and that you remove it as soon as you're done. Do not host DomainMOD on a public website or on an easy-to-guess URL. If you do end up hosting DomainMOD on a public website, you should use your website's robots.txt file to block bots and spiders from crawling your site, otherwise your DomainMOD URL may end up in public search results. Do not give the URL to anyone who does not need to access DomainMOD. You should treat the URL like a password. Always use the most up-to-date version of DomainMOD.

In order for DomainMOD to install and run, strict mode must to be disabled. To disable strict mode you need to edit your MySQL configuration file. In it there will be a line that looks like: sql-mode=\"STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\" To disable strict mode you need to remove STRICT_TRANS_TABLES from this line (including the comma after it, if there is one), which in this example would leave you with: sql-mode=\"NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\" Once disabled you will need to restart MySQL, and then DomainMOD should install properly. Note As of v4.11, DomainMOD will try to disable strict mode automatically during the database connection, but if you're still experiencing issues you should follow the steps above. I'm receiving an error that there are too many redirects The images and CSS are broken This is generally caused by an invalid web root in your config.inc.php file. Please double check your config.inc.php file and confirm that the $web_root variable reflects the directory where you installed DomainMOD. For example, if you access DomainMOD via the URL http://example.com/domains/ the $web_root variable should be: $web_root = \"/domains\"; (don't include a trailing slash!)

This is why we recommend you backup your DomainMOD installation directory and database before upgrading (you did make that backup, right?). Follow these steps to restore your copy of DomainMOD: Restore your DomainMOD database backup to the same location as your previous DomainMOD database. Instead of logging into DomainMOD to upgrade your database, run the below script from the command line. [FULL SERVER PATH TO DOMAINMOD]/update.php The full command will look something like this, depending on the location of PHP and DomainMOD on your server: /usr/bin/php -f /home/user/www/domainmod/update.php If you receive a notice that your upgrade was successful , switch back to your web browser and try to login to DomainMOD. If you're able to login successfully you can ignore the rest of these steps. If you receive a notice that your upgrade was unsuccessful , keep a record of any error messages that are displayed and proceed to the next step. Restore your DomainMOD database backup again, then download the previous version that you were using and go through the standard installation steps, pointing it at your newly-restored database in the config.inc.php file. This should get you back to where you were before you tried upgrading. Contact us with any error messages that were displayed and we'll try to help figure out what went wrong with your upgrade. Usage The software seems to be working properly, but some messages are being displayed, such as \" undefined index \" and \" undefined variable \" This is related to the error reporting level that you have turned on in PHP. Although these are only warnings and won't actually be breaking anything, you can get rid of them by editing your php.ini file and changing the error_reporting line. Right now you probably have something that looks like this: error_reporting = E_ALL But you should have something that looks like this: error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED Commented out in your php.ini file, above the error_reporting directive, there may be a suggested error reporting line for a \"Production\" environment. Try using that line instead of what you're using now, restart Apache/PHP, and that should get rid of the errors. I'm trying to connect DomainMOD to my domain registrar account using the API so that I can import my domains, but everything in the Domain Queue just says \"Pending\" In order to import your domains using the domain registrar's API you must setup the cron job that comes with DomainMOD. In addition to having the cron job running, you must also have your API credential saved along with your registrar account Asset. I'm trying to import data using the Domain Queue, but everything is stuck on \"Processing\" In case there's an issue with the cron job you can also try triggering the queue manually. Go to Administration -> Task Scheduler , and then beside \"Domain Queue Processing\" click the \"run now\" link (this may take a bit of time to run). Then go back to the queue and see if anything has changed. If that doesn't work you can try clearing the queue items that are currently processing by going to Administration -> Maintenance , and then clicking on \"Clear Queue Processing\". Now try the last suggestion again to see if running the queue manually through the Task Scheduler helps. If that still doesn't do it go to Administration -> Maintenance , and then click on \"Clear Queues\". This will completely clear out the queue. Now try retrieving your data again using the Domain Queue. I've setup the Data Warehouse within DomainMOD, but none of my changes propagate to my web server The Data Warehouse is read-only. You can import data from your web server into your Data Warehouse, but this data is for informational purposes only, and you can't edit your server data within DomainMOD and have it update your web server. This is something that will be worked on in the future, but is currently not possible. I'm getting the error, \"Database Connection Error: 1045\" Error 1045 is an access denied error, which seems to be caused when the user doesn't have appropriate permissions on the database, or there's another privilege issue with the database. Unfortunately this is pretty difficult to troubleshoot on our end, as there are many things that can cause this. We would recommend trying some of the suggestions for this error in Google and see if any of them help: https://www.google.com/search?q=Database+Connection+Error%3A+1045 . Form fields aren't displaying properly, such as checkboxes and text fields showing as empty boxes This is usually caused by JavaScript being disabled in your web browser. If enabling JavaScript doesn't fix the issue try disabling any ad blockers or other content blockers you may have installed. The currency conversions aren't working properly My fees are all showing up as zero This is usually caused by a currency converter that's experiencing downtime. You can fix this by changing the currency conversion source. Click Administration on the main menu, then click System Settings . Click on the Currency Converter dropdown menu and choose a new source. Click the Update System Settings button. After the Currency Converter source has been changed you can force a currency conversion update by going to Maintenance -> Update Conversion Rates . Debugging If you're still having issues you can enable Debugging Mode, which will make DomainMOD start logging your actions and errors, which can help us troubleshoot your issue.

To enable Debugging Mode: Click Administration on the main menu, then click System Settings . Change the Debugging Mode option to Enabled . Click the Update System Settings button. Once debugging is enabled use DomainMOD as you normally would, repeating the steps you took when you first encountered the issue. Once you've done this continue with the below steps. If you haven't already, visit the DomainMOD support forum or issue tracker and post about your issue. In DomainMOD, click on Administration and then Debug Log . Click the Export button to export the debugging log. In addition to the debugging log you should also retrieve your PHP error log, which will give us additional information about your issue. To find the location of your PHP error log: In DomainMOD, click on Administration and then System Information . Look for the heading named PHP Error Log Location . This will show you the location of the PHP error log on your web server. Once you have both your debugging log and PHP error log send an email to debugging@domainmod.org and attach the log files. Please also include the URL to your support forum post or issue tracker ticket so that we can determine the issue you're contacting us about. We will review your logs and get back to you as soon as we can! Also, if you haven't already, make sure you disable Debugging Mode. Helper Programs If all else fails, DomainMOD has some \"helper\" programs that support can supply you with in order to help investigate or fix your issue. Helper programs are nothing more than simple scripts that can perform actions on your DomainMOD installation, whether it's performing an update on your database or setting a temporary variable. Although helpers are generally custom and specific to the user's issue, we wanted to include a generic helper publicly so that users could get a feel for what helpers are and what they do. In DomainMOD v4.18, we implemented strict Content Security Policy headers in order to help secure the application and reduce the risk of certain web-based attacks. We also enabled forced HTTPS, which ensures that your DomainMOD installation will only work if you've secured your web hosting with an SSL certificate. Although we highly recommend keeping the CSP headers enabled, as well as using an SSL certificate to secure your DomainMOD installation, we realize that some users may not always be able to have these features enabled. If you're one of those users, and you need to disable CSP and HTTPS, you could use the below helper to do so. You would simply create the file /helpers/top.php and paste the below contents into it. That's all there is to it! The next time your visit your DomainMOD installation CSP and HTTPS will both be disabled. Warning If you're using a helper to investigate or fix something, and the helper is only intended to be used temporarily, don't forget to delete the helper file as soon as you're done using it! <?php // Contents of: /helpers/top.php $disable_csp = 1; $force_https = 0;","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#upgrading","text":"","title":"Upgrading"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#debugging","text":"If you're still having issues you can enable Debugging Mode, which will make DomainMOD start logging your actions and errors, which can help us troubleshoot your issue.
