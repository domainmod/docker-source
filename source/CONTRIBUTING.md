## Pull Requests

Before submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod/pulls), please contact the maintainers of the repository to discuss the change. As much as we appreciate you wanting to contribute, we don't want you to waste your time working on a change or new feature that won't get implemented (such as a feature that's already in progress).

## Issues & Feature Requests

If you've found a bug, spelling mistake, or any other issue that needs to be fixed, or you have a new feature request, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod/issues).

Before submitting a new issue, please search the archive to make sure that the issue hasn't already been addressed.

## Translations

If you're looking to contribute to DomainMOD by doing some translation work, please note that the language files are located in their own repository.
